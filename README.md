# Agile w Design Patterns Final
This repository  is an old interview question for Jr. Software Developers a major retail company in the mid-west. I was given permission to utilize this technical interview exercise for the purposes of this course.

This technical interview is traditionally administered over 1 hour. Applicants who did not complete the exercise were no longer considered for the position.

## What is this exam?
This exam contains supporting unit tests explaining the functionality of the code. However, there are many missing and/or broken aspects that need to be corrected. You will see some helpful comments and `TODO` notes to guide you where you need to add/fix the functionality.

The exam is a simplified version of Battleship. You have various types of ships with different sizes that can be added to a 10x10 grid. However, the ships can only be vertically aligned.

For example:

If a ship has covers 3 coordinates and you set the position to `(5,5)`; the coordinates the ship will cover are: `(5,5)`, `(5,4)`, and `(5,3)`. 

The unit tests describe the additional behaviors of the game.

You need to implement and/or fix all the functionality of the project described by the unit tests.

This exam also tests your ability to follow directions. Failure to do so will result in a 0.

## How this exam will be administered
This exam will be administered in-class. You will be given 3 hours to complete the exam. If you do not get all unit tests to pass, you will turn in what you have completed for evaluation.

## How you will complete this exam and Competencies
The following specifies how this exam needs to be completed.

### Version Control (Git)
You will complete this exam using version control practices that you have been demonstrated in-class. You will not receive points for the version control aspects of this assessment if you do not follow the exact details specified below:


- You fork this repository
- You will fix each feature in a separate branch. Adding ships, calling coordinates, implementing classes, etc. Utilize your best judgement on what should be a separate feature / branch.
- Never commit on master unless merging in a feature / branch.
- You do not push your changes to GitHub until *AFTER* the exam. Any changes pushed to GitHub before the alloted time for the exam expires will be considered cheating and will recieve a 0.
- You send a `pull request` at the end of the exam. Any pull requests sent *BEFORE* the exam is complete will be considered cheating and recieve a 0.

### OOP, TDD, and Efficient Code
You must follow object-oriented practices. You will need to demonstrate you understand the prerequesits of this course and how they can apply to test-driven development.

Your code needs to be clean and efficient. No obsure variable names, your objects do one thing and one thing only. Your methods perform only one specific task they describe.

### Problem-Solving Skills with an existing codebase
This is code someone else wrote. Demonstrate your flexibility to work with others in contributing to a final project.


### Understanding of Datatypes and Control Structures
Demonstrate an understanding of complex datatypes. Arrays, Vectors, Iterators, Enum, and POJO's (plain old java objects). If-Else, Switch, Loops, Recursion, Functions, Methods.

### Attention to Detail
Demonstrate the ability to follow directions to an exactness. 

### Utilization of Resources and Documentation
Demonstrate the ability to utilize resources and documentation effectively.

### Grading

Each competency specified above will be worth 10 points, totaling to 50. This will be graded as an *assessment*
